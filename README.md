# University-Pushdown-automaton


## Compilation and Execution

1) To compile all file :
    
        make

2) To run with options :

   - evaluation of automaton : 

            ./main -eval--phase-<1 or 3> <file> <word>
   
    - printing of automaton : 
   
            ./main -print--phase-<1 or 3> <file>

3) If you change code in a file, you need to do:

         make clean
   
   before to try to do "make".
