# University-Pushdown-automaton


## Compilation and Execution

1) To compile all file :

   - Move from the project root to src :
        
         cd src

   - Then you will be able to compile with :    
    
         make

2) To run with options :

   - evaluation of automaton : 

            ./main -eval <file> <word>
   
   - printing of automaton : 
   
            ./main -print <file>

   - printing the format of automaton file:

            ./main -format--phase-<1 or 3>          

3) If you change code in a file, you need to do:

         make clean
   
   before to try to do "make".
