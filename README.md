# University-Pushdown-automaton


## Compilation and Execution

1) To compile all file :
    
        make

2) To run with options :

   - evaluation of automaton : 

            ./parser < file -evaluation <word>
   
    - printing of automaton : 
   
            ./parser < file -print

3) If you change code in a file, you need to do:

         make clean
   
   before to try to do "make".
